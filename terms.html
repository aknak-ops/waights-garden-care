  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>I provide independent home and outdoor maintenance services in Canterbury and nearby areas. Prices are agreed before work begins unless extra tasks are added later. Payment is due on completion unless otherwise agreed.</p>

  <h3>Payment</h3>
  <p>I accept Monzo Mastercard, PayPal, or cash in hand.</p>

  <h3>Access & Safety</h3>
  <p>You must ensure safe access to the garden (gates unlocked, pets secured, fragile items moved). If I arrive and cannot work safely or access is blocked, a call-out fee may apply as described in the Refund & Cancellation Policy.</p>

  <h3>Liability</h3>
  <p>I take care in all work I do but I am not responsible for pre-existing damage, hidden underground services, or items left in the work area. My total liability is limited to the value of the specific service provided.</p>

  <h3>Insurance</h3>
  <p>I hold active public liability insurance covering accidental damage or injury during my work. Proof of insurance is available upon request.</p>

  <h3>Privacy</h3>
  <p>See my <a href='./privacy.html'>Privacy Policy</a> for how I handle your information.</p>

  <h3>Governing Law</h3>
