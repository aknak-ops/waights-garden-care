  <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>No deposits are required.</strong> You only pay once the agreed work is complete unless another arrangement has been made in writing.</p>

  <h3>Changing or cancelling your booking</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>More than 12 hours notice:</strong> free to cancel or reschedule at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>Within 12 hours of the agreed start time:</strong> £8 short-notice cancellation fee applies.</li>
    <li><strong>No access or missed appointment:</strong> £8 call-out fee (to cover travel and time set aside).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>If I need to reschedule or cancel</h3>
  <p>If I need to postpone the work (for example, due to heavy rain or another unavoidable issue), Ill offer the next available slot or cancel at no cost to you.</p>

  <h3>Extra work or scope changes</h3>
  <p>If extra work is requested or required when I arrive, Ill confirm any new price with you before starting.</p>

  <h3>Refunds</h3>
  <p>As no deposits are taken, refunds are rarely needed. If you ever pay in advance by mistake, Ill refund the full amount through your original payment method.</p>

  <p class='notice'>This policy ensures I can keep my schedule reliable while being flexible and fair for both sides.</p>
