  <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>No deposits.</strong> I keep things simple: you only pay after the agreed work is completed, unless we agree otherwise in writing.</p>

  <h3>Changing or cancelling your booking</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>More than 48 hours notice:</strong> free to cancel or reschedule.</li>
    <li><strong>2448 hours notice:</strong> small late-cancellation fee of £10 to cover time set aside.</li>
    <li><strong>Less than 24 hours notice or missed appointment (no access):</strong> £20 call-out fee.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>If I need to reschedule or cancel</h3>
  <p>If I need to change the date (for example due to weather or unforeseen issues), Ill offer the next available slot. If I cancel, there is no fee.</p>

  <h3>Scope changes or extra work</h3>
  <p>If extra work is requested or needed on-site, Ill provide a price and only proceed if you agree.</p>

  <h3>Refunds</h3>
  <p>Because there are no deposits, refunds are usually not applicable. If youve paid in advance by mistake, I will refund the amount in full to the original payment method.</p>

  <p class='notice'>This policy is designed to be fair: flexible when plans change, and clear about short-notice costs that cover wasted travel/time.</p>
